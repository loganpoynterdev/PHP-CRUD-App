# PHP-CRUD-App
 > A PHP CRUD app connected to a MySQL database making use of [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) to secure database credentials on the application itself. This was created as part of college coursework while learning web development and would like to continue building on this to expand on functionality.
